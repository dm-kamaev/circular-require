# circular-require

**UNMAINTAINED**: This module is no longer maintained, and installing it will
trigger a warning from npm. ES6 modules have no constraints around circular
imports, and are the recommended style of JavaScript in the future. This module
also has limitations on the ES6 features it can support, due to its dependencies
being vintage. If you'd like to adopt it, please do! File an issue and I'll
happily transfer ownership to you.

Detect circular require statements in a codebase.

## Install

```sh
$ npm install -g circular-require
```

## Use

`circular-require` provides a single command that takes an entry point
as its one argument. If it is run in a directory with a package.json
with browserify.transform field, it'll use those transforms while resolving
dependencies.

```sh
$ ~/src/app-stylesã€‰circular-require src/index.js
